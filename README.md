# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A bar chart [United States GDP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json)

xScale uses scaleBand() to plots the years along the x-axis(width of the screen).

yScale uses scaleLinear() to plot the values of the bars. d[1] values of the dataArray are gdp that are visualized along the height of the screen.
